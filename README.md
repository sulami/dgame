# DGame

Because I can't come up with a name.

Game-like 3D-rendering using D and OpenGL.

## Features

- Can load .obj-models from Blender
- And texturize them
- Can use shaders
- Simple light sources are included
- As well as rudimentary entity management
- Keyboard-/mouse-input to fly around

## Building

To build, just run it through `dub`.

It needs `SDL2` and `SDL2_image`, which you should be able to get through your
distribution's package manager.

## What it looks like:
